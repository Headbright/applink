# How you can Contribute

Feel free to open an issue in order to discuss any thoughts, comments, questions and suggestions that you might have.

## Code contributions

- Clone the `main` branch on your machine.

- Use your favourite IDE or text editor to make changes. Do not commit your editor's configuration files.

### Run and add tests

You can run tests using `npm run test` in the root of the project.

Each addition to the codebase that introduces something new, or changes the way an existing piece of code works, should add or update relevant tests.

### Please respect the existing coding style

- Spaces, not tabs.
- Avoid bringing in new libraries or dependencies without good justification. Any PR that brings in a new library needs to make the case for why it is necessary.

### Open a pull request with your changes (targeting the `main` branch)!
